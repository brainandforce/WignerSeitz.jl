This is the form of the \"superbase\" described in Conway and Sloane's 1992 paper.\n\nEssentially, this can be thought of as a \"QRU\" decomposition, where Q is a point isometry  (rotation/reflection/etc.), R is an upper triangular matrix (this essentially reorients the basis vectors of the space), and U is a unimodular matrix (all lattices whose basis vectors are  transformed by a unimodular matrix are identical), which permutes the columns of R, In this case, we minimize the dot product ofeach column of R with itself by right multiplication with a  suitable unimodular matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
